                <span class="font-semibold text-lg">Problem Statement</span>
                A manual, Excel-based options chain contest was complex and inefficient, making data retrieval difficult and slowing decision-making processes. The lack of interactive elements and incentives led to low user engagement.
            </p>

            <p class="flex flex-col gap-2 font-light text-base text-zinc-700 bg-zinc-200 rounded-3xl p-4">
                <span class="font-semibold text-lg">Objective</span>
                To automate the contest and make it real-time, with up-to-date, high-quality data, improved decision-making accuracy, and enhanced operational efficiency. An additional goal was to boost user interaction, foster user commitment, and generate business leads.
            </p>

                <span class="font-semibold text-lg ">Method</span>
                Develop a software solution to replace the Excel spreadsheet, incorporating a custom search tool for efficient data retrieval. The new platform was designed to deliver real-time results and featured a dynamic leaderboard to promote competition and user engagement.
            </p>

            <p class="flex flex-col gap-2 font-light text-base text-zinc-700 bg-zinc-200 rounded-3xl p-4">
                <span class="font-semibold text-lg ">Implementation</span>
                Used advanced coding techniques to build the automated platform. The custom search tool was implemented, significantly streamlining data retrieval and decision-making. A live leaderboard was added to foster competition and incentivize long-term commitment.
            </p>
