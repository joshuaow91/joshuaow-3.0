                Successfully transitioning from a complex, Excel-based system, this project introduced an efficient, automated real-time platform for an options contest. Users can select an options contract through a custom search tool, with data updating in real time once the market opens. The platform features a leaderboard that ranks user performance and charts that visually represent market trends and user biases, creating a competitive and educational environment for stock market enthusiasts.
